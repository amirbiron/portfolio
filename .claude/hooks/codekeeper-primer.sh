# CodeKeeper primer — SessionStart hook for Claude Code on the web.
#
# Fetches the agent instructions from CodeKeeper and prints them. Claude Code
# injects a SessionStart hook's stdout into the session context, so whatever
# lands on stdout is read before the first message.
#
# Why this file exists at all, when the codekeeper-memory plugin already ships
# the same hook: web session containers are started with
# SKIP_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE=true, so no marketplace plugin is materialised there
# — no plugin directory, no CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, and the plugin's hook never
# runs. Account-level skills do sync (CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS=1); plugins do
# not. A hook committed to the repo is the delivery path that survives.
#
# Remote only, on purpose. Where plugins DO load, the plugin's own hook runs
# and this one would print the primer a second time. Gating on
# CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE keeps exactly one copy on every surface, without a marker
# file that would also suppress the legitimate re-inject after a compact.
#
# stdout is context the agent reads; stderr is a message to the human. Nothing
# but the primer may reach stdout, or the agent reads our error text as if it
# were Amir's instructions. Silence is reserved for HTTP 204 — no instructions
# configured — because a hook that is silent on failure is indistinguishable
# from one that works, which is how a broken URL survives for months.
#
# Every path exits 0. A failure here must never stop a session from starting.
